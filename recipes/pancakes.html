      A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but
      it's the best I've ever made!

      Steps
      <ol>
        <li>
          Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
          soda, and salt in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted
          butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry
          ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and
          mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended.
          Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake
          is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides
          are brown.
