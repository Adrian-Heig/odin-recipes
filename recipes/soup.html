      Steps
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the first step of this chicken noodle soup recipe, diced onions and
          chopped celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and
          vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just
          use one or the other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie
          chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a
          budget-friendly shortcut.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too
          long will make them mushy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the
          end of cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the saut√©ed
          vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken
          noodle soup recipe.
